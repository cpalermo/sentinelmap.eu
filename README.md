## sentinelmap.eu

The main purpose of this project is to provide, the best possible cloud-free mosaic of Sentinel-2 images. The intent is to cover a significant region of Europe through a web map open to everyone. From June, the map covers an area of 2.4 million kmÂ² with a total of 38.7 billion pixel.

Please consider that this website is now in early development phase. The plan is to improve the map during next months and, if it is possible, grew in terms of coverage.
